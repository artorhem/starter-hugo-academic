       I was the __Teaching Assistant for CPSC 319: Software Engineering Project__ at UBC from September 2017 to April 2018. This course provides an opportunity to undergrad students to design, implement and test on a large software system for an industry sponsor. The focus in this course is to apply waterfall SDLC methodology to the solution from inception to production, producing key documentation artefacts while working in a team. 
       
       I acted as the industry sponsor liason and "engineering manager" to the teams. Over the course of the year, I overlooked two projects and managed about 40 students.
 
        * Managed two teams implementing a self-service tool for Uniserve clients and IT support staff.The tool allows the IT staff to manage their devices and see real time information about their network health and usage trends.
        
        * Supervised two student teams implementing a self-checkout and payment portal for ChainXY.

       I was the Teaching Assistant for [CPSC 508: Advanced Operating Systems](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/teaching/CS508.19/index.html) This seminar-style course introduces students to the theory and practice of conducting systems research. The papers discussed cover the history of operating systems research with a special emphasis on understanding what constitutes systems research and how it has evolved. 
       
       As a Teaching Assistant, I help students with their assignments and term projects - right from defining scope to finding the right compute resources for them to use. I also ran tutorials to bring the undergraduate students up to speed so that they can have a richer learning experience.
