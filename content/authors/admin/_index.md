Hi! I am a third year PhD Computer Science student at the [University of British
Columbia](https://cs.ubc.ca). I am a member of the [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca), and am supervised by
[Prof. Margo Seltzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/).

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Ivan
Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai) for my masters degree. My thesis
explored trusted execution for cross-platform data privacy. Prior to that I
worked at [NetApp Inc.](https://www.netapp.com/us/index.aspx), making tools and
utilities to make Linux hosts work seamlessly with NetApp's Data ONTAP.
